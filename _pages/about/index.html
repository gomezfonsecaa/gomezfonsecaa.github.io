I received my PhD in <a href="https://math.nd.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> from the <a href="https://www.nd.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Notre Dame</a> in May 2025. My PhD advisor was <a href="https://math.nd.edu/people/faculty/roxana-smarandache/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Roxana Smarandache</a>.</p> <p>My research interests lie in coding theory and graph theory. I have been interested in the construction of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, particularly protograph-based and quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, and in the optimization of their parameters. To solve problems in these areas, I use methodologies from algebra and applied algebra, combinatorics, discrete mathematics, and optimization. I am also interested in investigating broader families of error-correcting codes, such as generalized LDPC codes and codes from expander graphs, and quantum error correction.</p> <p>This website is still under construction. :)</p> </body></html>
