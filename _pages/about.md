[//]: # Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: # Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I received my PhD in [Mathematics](https://math.nd.edu) from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) in May 2025. My PhD advisor was [Dr. Roxana Smarandache](https://math.nd.edu/people/faculty/roxana-smarandache/). 

My research interests lie in coding theory and graph theory. I have been interested in the construction of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, particularly protograph-based and quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, and in the optimization of their parameters. To solve problems in these areas, I use methodologies from algebra and applied algebra, combinatorics, discrete mathematics, and optimization. I am also interested in investigating broader families of error-correcting codes, such as generalized LDPC codes and codes from expander graphs, and quantum error correction.

This website is still under construction. :)
